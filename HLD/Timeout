Connection Timeout 
The maximum time allowed to establish a connection to the server.
Happens before any data is sent or received.
Protects against situations where the server is unreachable, down, or too slow to respond to the initial handshake.
Example: If you set ConnectionTimeout = 5 seconds and the server doesn’t accept the connection within that time, you’ll get a ConnectionTimeoutException


SocetTimeout 
The maximum time allowed for waiting on data after the connection has been established.
Happens after the connection is open, during data transfer.
Protects against situations where the server accepts the connection but doesn’t send data, or the network stalls mid-transfer.
Example: If you set SocketTimeout = 10 seconds and the server doesn’t send a response within that time, you’ll get a SocketTimeoutException
