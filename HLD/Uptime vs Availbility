Uptime : percenatge if time a system is up and running  
Example: no downtime in 2 month uptime is 100% , if 2 hr outage then uptime is 99.86% 
it shows reliability but does not guramtee usability
machine is running  
 Uptime %=(Total time system is running /Total time in period)×100
downtime = total-uptime 

Avaiblity : Avaiblity includes both system uptime and schedules maintenance 
if system is up but not accessible to user then system avaibality is low 
it reflect overall system reliability  
user expecience 
 Avaiblity %=(uptime-planned maintenance /Total time in period)×100
